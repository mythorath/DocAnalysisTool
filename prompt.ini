# Goal: Create a modular Python CLI tool to download, OCR, and analyze public comment letters from a list of URLs.
# Target environment: Python 3.10+, run locally on Windows or Linux
# Input: CSV file of Federal Register comment letter links (PDFs and other formats)
# Output: 
#   1. Folder of all documents (PDFs and OCR'd .txt files)
#   2. Searchable keyword index
#   3. Grouped/clustering summary CSV by topics or keywords

# === MODULES TO IMPLEMENT ===

# ✅ 1. downloader.py
# Description: Load the CSV, extract URLs, download PDFs, retry failed links, and save sanitized filenames.
# Requirements:
#   - Read CSV using pandas
#   - Create download folder if it doesn't exist
#   - Skip already downloaded files
#   - Log failed URLs to a file
# STOP AND REVIEW after implementing downloader.py

# ✅ 2. extractor.py
# Description: Load each PDF, determine if text-based or scanned. Extract text or perform OCR using Tesseract.
# Requirements:
#   - Use PyMuPDF (fitz) or pdfminer.six for text extraction
#   - If no extractable text, use pdf2image + pytesseract
#   - Save extracted text as .txt files named after the PDF
#   - Track and log any files with unreadable or failed OCR
# STOP AND REVIEW after implementing extractor.py

# ✅ 3. indexer.py
# Description: Build a full-text index of all extracted text files.
# Requirements:
#   - Use SQLite FTS5, Whoosh, or similar
#   - Index fields: filename, source URL, text content
#   - Provide CLI search functionality (keyword/phrase query → ranked results)
# STOP AND REVIEW after implementing indexer.py

# ✅ 4. grouper.py
# Description: Group or cluster comment letters by dominant keywords or themes.
# Requirements:
#   - Extract top N keywords using TF-IDF or KeyBERT
#   - Optionally use BERTopic or sentence embeddings + KMeans for grouping
#   - Output CSV: filename, top keywords, group label, summary (first 500 chars), link to original file
# STOP AND REVIEW after implementing grouper.py

# ✅ 5. report_generator.py (Optional)
# Description: Generate a human-readable summary report (CSV, Excel, or HTML).
# Fields:
#   - File name
#   - Group/topic
#   - Keyword hits
#   - Search matches (if applicable)
#   - Notes on formatting or OCR status

# sqlite3 or whoosh for indexing

# === DEVELOPMENT INSTRUCTIONS ===
# 1. Implement downloader.py first. It should take input CSV and download all files.
# 2. STOP AND REVIEW after each module.
# 3. Use logging and CLI arguments where appropriate.
# 4. Do not write monolithic code. Maintain one file per module.
# 5. Include `if __name__ == "__main__"` where needed for CLI execution.

# === START CODING ===
# Start with downloader.py. Include progress bars with tqdm.
# Validate URL formats and sanitize file names.
# Use try/except blocks for each download and retry up to 3 times.
