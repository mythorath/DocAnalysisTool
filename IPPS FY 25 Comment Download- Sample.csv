CMS-2025-0028-0125,University of Michigan Health Regional Network,,,,,,"I am writing as the Regional Medical Director for the University of Michigan Health Sparrow/West and lead physician advisor.  I would like to report that MA plans are denying readmissions frequently citing CMS policy when in fact, the admissions clearly meet CMS criteria for separate reimbursement.  It is not just one MA plan, but several here within Michigan and I'm sure, across the country.  These MA plans are creating their own policies and denying nearly any readmission within 30 days for any reason.  This completely violates their obligation to adhere to CMS rules and regulations and significantly affects hospital reimbursement when we have support and documentation that the majority of these cases should be separately reimbursed.  We are asking that you hold MA plans accountable for this poor behavior before adjusting regulations about HRRP which will further harm the financial viability of our non-profit hospitals. Readmission denials from MA plans are not in alignment with the intent of HRRP but are being used as a carte blanch reason for poor behavior.  Also MA plans also should not be reporting HCC data from inpatient admission claims that they are then denying.  How is this being monitored?    ",Health Care Professional/Association - Physician,
