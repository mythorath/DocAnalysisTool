To Whom It May Concern, 
As a cardiothoracic surgeon, I routinely care for patients whose cardiac disease is complicated by 
atrial fibrillation (AF). From early diagnosis to advanced, chronic stages, AF significantly impacts 
surgical risk, operative planning, and long-term outcomes. The distinction between newly diagnosed 
AF and long-standing persistent or permanent AF is not a matter of degree alone—it reflects a 
fundamental shift in disease complexity, prognosis, and the intensity of care required. 
Newly Diagnosed Atrial Fibrillation 
In patients with newly diagnosed AF—often paroxysmal or early persistent—the atria typically 
maintain relatively normal structure and function. These individuals are often candidates for early 
rhythm control and benefit from catheter-based or surgical interventions with relatively high 
success rates. When surgery is indicated for concurrent cardiac issues (e.g., valve repair, coronary 
artery bypass grafting), adjunctive procedures such as surgical ablation or left atrial appendage 
exclusion can be performed with favorable outcomes. Stroke risk is generally more manageable, 
and the perioperative course tends to be more predictable and less resource-intensive. 
Long-standing Persistent or Permanent Atrial Fibrillation 
In stark contrast, patients with long-standing persistent or permanent AF—those with arrhythmia 
duration over 12 months—present a different category of disease altogether. By this stage, the atria 
have often undergone significant structural remodeling, including dilation and fibrosis, which 
compromises both mechanical function and the potential for rhythm restoration. In the surgical 
setting, this structural deterioration increases the complexity of procedures, particularly when 
rhythm interventions such as biatrial ablation or left atrial appendage occlusion are required. 
Furthermore, these patients frequently have a high burden of comorbid conditions—chronic heart 
failure, renal impairment, prior cerebrovascular events—that increase operative risk and complicate

postoperative recovery. They often require lifelong anticoagulation, careful rhythm and rate control 
strategies, and coordinated follow-up involving electrophysiologists, heart failure specialists, and 
anticoagulation management teams. 
From a resource standpoint, patients with long-standing or permanent AF require significantly more 
intensive care. Operative times are longer, complications more frequent, hospital stays extended, and 
readmission rates higher. Surgical planning is more nuanced, and postoperative care demands greater 
coordination and monitoring. These patients do not represent a simple progression of early-stage

AF—they embody a different level of disease, requiring a fundamentally higher intensity of care. 
Conclusion 
Given the marked differences in structural pathology, perioperative risk, comorbidity burden, and 
resource utilization, I respectfully urge the Agency to reclassify long-standing persistent and 
permanent atrial fibrillation as major comorbid conditions. This designation would more 
accurately reflect the clinical reality and support the multidisciplinary, resource-intensive care these 
patients require.
