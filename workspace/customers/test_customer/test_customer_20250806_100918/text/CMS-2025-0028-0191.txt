To Whom It May Concern, 
As Chief of the Division of Cardiac Surgery, Vice Chair of the Department of Surgery, and Distinguished 
Professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, I have devoted my career to advancing the field 
of cardiothoracic surgery through clinical care, education, and leadership. I hold the Robert and Kelly Day 
Chair in Cardiothoracic Surgery and have had the honor of serving in multiple national leadership roles, 
including Chair of the American Board of Thoracic Surgery, Director of both the Society of Thoracic 
Surgeons and the American Association for Thoracic Surgery, and Governor of the American College of 
Surgeons. I currently serve as President of the Board of the Greater Los Angeles Chapter of the American 
Heart Association. 
Throughout my career, I have witnessed the evolving complexity of cardiac surgery, particularly when atrial 
fibrillation (AF) is present. One of the most significant distinctions in managing patients with AF is the 
difference between newly diagnosed or paroxysmal AF and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation 
(LSPAF). These forms of the disease differ not only in duration but in structural pathology, surgical risk, and 
healthcare resource demands. 
Newly Diagnosed Atrial Fibrillation 
Patients with newly diagnosed or early-stage AF often maintain relatively normal atrial anatomy and 
function. Surgical interventions, including concomitant ablation during cardiac surgery, are highly effective 
in this group and can often restore sinus rhythm with minimal added complexity. Adjunctive procedures, 
such as left atrial appendage exclusion, can be performed with good outcomes. The perioperative course in 
these cases is usually predictable, with lower complication rates and resource needs. 
Long-Standing Persistent Atrial Fibrillation 
In contrast, patients with LSPAF—defined by sustained arrhythmia lasting more than 12 months—represent 
a distinctly more advanced and resource-intensive form of the disease. These patients typically present 
with significant atrial remodeling, including fibrosis and dilation, that impairs both mechanical and electrical 
function. As a result, surgical management becomes substantially more complex. 
Concomitant surgical ablation in patients with LSPAF is essential to address rhythm control and reduce 
stroke risk. Notably, both the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) 
endorse concomitant surgical ablation with a Class I recommendation during cardiac surgery for patients 
with AF. However, achieving effective ablation in LSPAF requires specialized energy sources, advanced 
mapping techniques, and increased operative time—resources that go well beyond those needed for 
patients with early-stage AF. Additional devices, such as bipolar radiofrequency or cryothermal ablation 
tools, are essential to the procedure. 
Moreover, patients with LSPAF often have a higher burden of comorbidities—chronic heart failure, renal 
insufficiency, cerebrovascular disease—that further elevate surgical risk and complicate recovery. These 
patients require prolonged hospital stays, higher levels of postoperative monitoring, and coordinated care 
involving electrophysiologists, heart failure specialists, and anticoagulation teams. 
Conclusion 
Given the increased structural disease burden, procedural complexity, device requirements, and intensity 
of postoperative care, long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation should be reclassified as a major 
comorbid condition. This change would more accurately reflect the clinical and resource realities faced by 
cardiac surgeons and the multidisciplinary teams that care for these high-risk patients. 
 
Sincerely,
