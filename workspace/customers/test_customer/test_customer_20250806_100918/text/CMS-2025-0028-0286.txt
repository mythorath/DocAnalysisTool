To Whom It May Concern, 
 
As a clinical cardiac electrophysiologist practicing at a large academic referral center, I 
care for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) across the full spectrum of the disease—from 
those with newly diagnosed paroxysmal AF to those with long-standing, complex, and 
chronic forms of AF. In addition to my clinical role, I serve as the Program Director for 
our Cardiac Electrophysiology fellowship, and I have the privilege of mentoring fellows 
who are learning to navigate the many challenges of AF management. 
 
Through years of caring for these patients and teaching others to do the same, I’ve 
seen firsthand that the difference between early paroxysmal AF and long-standing 
persistent or permanent AF is not simply a matter of progression—it’s a difference in 
kind. These are fundamentally distinct disease states that carry very different clinical 
implications and require very different levels of care. 
 
In newly diagnosed AF—typically paroxysmal or early persistent—the atria are often 
structurally and electrically intact. These patients tend to have more manageable 
symptoms and respond well to rhythm control strategies. With appropriate 
anticoagulation and, in many cases, a single catheter ablation procedure, we can often 
restore sinus rhythm and achieve favorable outcomes with relatively modest resource 
use. 
 
Patients with long-standing persistent or permanent AF, on the other hand, present a 
very different challenge. They’ve often failed multiple therapies. Their atria have 
undergone extensive remodeling, making rhythm control strategies—including catheter 
ablation—less effective and more technically complex. Antiarrhythmic medications are 
also less effective and carry greater risks. 
 
These patients often have significant comorbidities such as heart failure, chronic kidney 
disease, or prior stroke, all of which complicate management. Their thromboembolic risk 
is higher, often requiring lifelong anticoagulation with careful attention to bleeding risk. 
Their care frequently involves repeated hospitalizations and the coordination of multiple

specialties, including heart failure management, anticoagulation services, and advanced 
electrophysiology care. 
 
From a resource standpoint, managing these patients demands substantially more: 
longer and more frequent hospital stays, advanced procedures, complex medication 
regimens, and intensive follow-up. They are not simply further along a continuum; they 
are in a distinct category of disease with greater complexity and risk, requiring a much 
higher level of clinical attention. 
 
Given this reality, I respectfully urge the Agency to reclassify long-standing persistent 
and permanent atrial fibrillation as major comorbid conditions. This change would more 
accurately reflect the clinical complexity we encounter daily and help ensure that these 
patients receive the level of care and support they need. 
 
 
 
Sincerely,
