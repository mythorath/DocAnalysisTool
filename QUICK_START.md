# ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

## 1. Deploy to Railway (Recommended)

Railway is perfect for production because it supports persistent storage and background processing.

### Step 1: Install Railway CLI
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

### Step 2: Deploy
```bash
python railway_deploy.py
```

### Step 3: Access Your Platform
- Your platform will be live at the URL provided
- Default admin login: `admin@platform.com` / `admin123`
- **Change the admin password immediately!**

## 2. Deploy to Vercel (For Demos)

Vercel is great for quick demos but has limitations for production use.

### Step 1: Install Vercel CLI
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### Step 2: Create Config
```bash
python vercel_deploy.py
```

### Step 3: Deploy
```bash
vercel
```

## 3. First Steps After Deployment

### 1. Secure Your Platform
- Visit your platform URL
- Login as admin: `admin@platform.com` / `admin123`
- **Immediately change the admin password**
- Note down your platform URL

### 2. Create Your First Customer
- In admin dashboard, click "Add Customer"
- Fill in customer details:
  - Email address
  - Full name
  - Organization (optional)
  - Temporary password
- Customer will use email + password to login

### 3. Process Customer Documents
- Click "Process Data" in admin dashboard
- Select the customer
- Enter project name and description
- Upload CSV file with document URLs (must have "Document ID" and "URL" columns)
- Click "Start Processing"

### 4. Customer Access
- Send customer the platform URL and their login credentials
- Customer logs in to see their private dashboard
- Customer can search documents and export results

## 4. Platform URLs

After deployment, you'll have:
- **Platform URL**: Your main platform (get from Railway/Vercel)
- **Admin Dashboard**: `https://your-url.com/admin`
- **Customer Login**: `https://your-url.com/login`

## 5. File Structure

Your platform will create this structure:
```
platform_data/
â”œâ”€â”€ admin/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ platform.db (main database)
â”œâ”€â”€ customers/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [customer-id]/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ projects/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ uploads/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ databases/
â””â”€â”€ logs/
```

## 6. Security Features

âœ… **Customer Isolation**: Each customer sees only their own data  
âœ… **Secure Authentication**: Password hashing and session management  
âœ… **Audit Logging**: All actions are logged for security  
âœ… **Data Protection**: Encrypted sessions and secure headers  
âœ… **Role-Based Access**: Admin vs customer permissions  

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **"Admin login failed"**: Use exact credentials `admin@platform.com` / `admin123`
- **"Processing stuck"**: Check that CSV has "Document ID" and "URL" columns
- **"Can't access customer data"**: Verify customer is logged in with correct email
- **"Search not working"**: Ensure document processing completed successfully

### Getting Help:
- Check platform logs in Railway/Vercel dashboard
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure your CSV file format is correct
